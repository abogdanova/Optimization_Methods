# Optimization Methods
Compilation of my own take on some optimization methods, having the BBOB <https://github.com/numbbo/coco> as benchmark.


## Implemented methods
+ Simulated Annealing
+ Diferencial Evolution
+ Particle Swarm Optimization

## Next methods
+ Evolutionary Strategies

## TODO
+ Replace lower and upper bound by pre/post processing tool, the algorithms then will work by default on [-1, +1].
